Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?

ans:-
Thread:
Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it

It has multiple methods including start() and run()

Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread 

Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java hence after a class extends Thread class, it can not extend any other class

Runnable:
Runnable is a functional interface which is used to create a thread
It has only abstract method run()
Multiple threads share the same objects.
If a class is implementing the runnable interface then your class can extend another class.
