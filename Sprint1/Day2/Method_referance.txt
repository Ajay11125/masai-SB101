Method references are a special type of lambda expressions. They're often used to create simple lambda expressions by referencing existing methods.

--we can take a reference of a non-static method using object::methodName

--we can take a reference of a static method using ClassName::methodName

--we can take a reference of a constructor also using ClassName::new

Example:-

Object :: methodName
