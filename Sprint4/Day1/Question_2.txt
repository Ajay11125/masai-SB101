Q2/- What is JDBC, Write a note on JDBC driver software.

Ans:-
Java™ database connectivity (JDBC) is the JavaSoft specification of a standard application programming interface (API) that allows Java programs to access database management systems. The JDBC API consists of a set of interfaces and classes written in the Java programming language.

Using these standard interfaces and classes, programmers can write applications that connect to databases, send queries written in structured query language (SQL), and process the results.

Since JDBC is a standard specification, one Java program that uses the JDBC API can connect to any database management system (DBMS), as long as a driver exists for that particular DBMS.

JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses ODBC driver to connect to the database. The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls. Type-1 driver is also called Universal driver because it can be used to connect to any of the databases.

As a common driver is used in order to interact with different databases, the data transferred through this driver is not so secured.
The ODBC bridge driver is needed to be installed in individual client machines.
Type-1 driver isn’t written in java, that’s why it isn’t a portable driver.
This driver software is built-in with JDK so no need to install separately.
It is a database independent driver.
