Q1:-What is the difference between Statment and PreparedStatement?

Ans:-

1. Statement : 
It is used for accessing your database. Statement interface cannot accept parameters and useful when you are using static SQL statements at runtime. If you want to run SQL query only once then this interface is preferred over PreparedStatement. 
It is used when SQL query is to be executed only once.
You can not pass parameters at runtime.
Used for CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements.
We can not use statement for reading binary data.
Performance is very low.
2.
It is used when you want to use SQL statements many times. The PreparedStatement interface accepts input parameters at runtime. 
Used for the queries which are to be executed multiple times.
You can pass parameters at runtime.
It is used when SQL query is to be executed multiple times.
Performance is better than Statement.
It extends statement interface.
We can use Preparedstatement for reading binary data.
